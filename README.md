# Python api_utils Merge Template

## Quick Start
This is a template to create a custom api_utils for your system. To use this template, create a new repo using this template, then clone down your new repo, and your system specifications repo, and use the ``make merge`` command as shown below. 
```sh
## Merge your specifications with the template
make merge ../SystemRepo/Specifications
```
and you have a working Python API Utils repo ready to go, refresh you view of the README for more information, or just run ``pipenv install --dev`` to start working with your utils repo.
